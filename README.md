AI-Toolbox
==========

This C++ toolbox is aimed at representing and solving common AI problems,
implementing an easy-to-use interface which should be hopefully extensible
to many problems, while keeping code readable.

Current development includes MDPs and related algorithms. This toolbox
has been partially developed using code from the Matlab MDPToolbox,
which you can find [here](http://www7.inra.fr/mia/T/MDPtoolbox/)
